1.  Use logical operators to find whether the age of a person lies between 10 and 20?
Ans. let age = prompt("ENTER YOUR AGE");
        if(age>=10 && age <=20)
        console.log("yes, it does");

2. Demonstrate the use of Switch case in JS.
 let fruit = prompt("Enter your favorite fruit name to know the cost of it ");
 switch(fruit)
{
case 'Apple':
console.log( " cost is 100 per kg.");
break;
case 'Orange':
console.log(" cost is 120 per kg. ");
break;
case 'Grapes':
console.log(" cost is 80 per kg. ");
break;
default:
console.log("Sorry, we don't sell this fruit");
}

3. Write a JS program to find whether a number is divisible by 2 and 3 .
Ans. 
let number= prompt("ENTER A NUMBER");
number=Number.parseInt(number);
if(number%2==0 && number%3==0)
console.log("number is divisible by both 2 and 3");
else if(number %2==0 || number%3==0)
console.log("number is divisible by either 2 or 3");
else
console.log("Number not divisible");
